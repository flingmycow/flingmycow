## Hi, I'm Fumi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Customer Engineer specialising in Smart Analytics at Google Cloud. I used to be a data engineer where I primarily used Python and SQL to write scripts and data pipelines for creating clean, reuseable datasets. I have also _dabbled_ with basic web development and devops. Technical things aside I love reading, travelling, cooking delicious food, board games, silly cartoons and cute stuff.
