### Hi, I'm Fumi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer (soon to be Customer Engineer at Google!) and use Python and SQL to write scripts and data pipelines for creating clean, reuseable datasets. I have also _dabbled_ with basic web development and devops. Technical things aside I am passionate about D&I, love reading, cooking delicious food, games, silly cartoons and cute stuff.
